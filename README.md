# Iris-Classifier
The project revolves around creating a neural network to classify the iris plants into three species. Data used in this project is from Ronald Aylmer Fisher's 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". Dataset is retrieved from UCI Machine Learning's Kaggle page and is licenced as CC0: Public Domain

# Goals of this Project
While the overall goal of this project is to create a classification model of the iris dataset, this project will also focus on providing a practise/learning for the following attributes:
1. Practise creating a reusable code base
2. Implementation of meaningful testcases
3. Practise writing and updating documentation in a clear and concise manner

Further documentation will explain in more detail how these goals will be met.
